                <p><i>I'm filled with excitement about the future.</i> One aspect that I'm particularly looking forward to is becoming an active member of the coding community. I believe that by collaborating, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other, we can push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital reality. I'm eager to contribute, learn from others, and make lasting connections with fellow developers.<br>
                Outside of my professional life, I prioritize my relationships with family and friends. They provide the love, support, and inspiration that keep me motivated and grounded. Whether it's spending quality time together, embarking on new adventures, or simply enjoying each other's company, these connections bring joy to my life.

                        <p>This project was my first graded project, and second one I made myself. Some of the material was provided with a theme, but I had the liberty on doing with it what I think would be the best. At this point we have only worked with HTML and CSS. </p>

                    <p>This is the first site I ever made. It was a project for HTML&CSS course at Noroff university. We had to implement design features that we have learned previously, also begginers knowledge in HTML&CSS. Later on, we had opportunity to make it more functional with JavaScript. Theme was given to us, products and logo, the rest was up to us.</p>
