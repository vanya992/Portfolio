                <h1>About me...</h1>
                <p> In the realm of frontend development, where pixels align and interfaces come alive, I channel my passion for coding into captivating user experiences. Like a yogi finding harmony in movement, I embrace the flow of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating seamless connections that engage and inspire. Just as a master chef combines flavors with precision, I craft clean and visually appealing designs, plating intuitive navigation and delightful interactions. And amidst it all, my love for gardening nurtures a creative spirit, as I cultivate innovative ideas that bloom into captivating web solutions.</p>

                        <p>This project was my first graded project, and second one I made myself. Some of the material was provided with a theme, but I had the liberty on doing with it what I think would be the best. At this point we have only worked with HTML and CSS. </p>

We had to implement design features that we have learned previously, also begginers knowledge in HTML&CSS. Later on, we had opportunity to make it more functional with JavaScript. Theme was given to us, products and logo, the rest was up to us.</p>
